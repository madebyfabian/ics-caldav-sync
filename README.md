# Email ICS Sync

Add your .ics attachments to your WebDAV calendar!
ICS to CalDAV is a simple service that allows you to connect to your
email account, get all messages with .ics attachments and add them to
your WebDAV calendar.

I've created it because I have an email account that regularly receives
.ics attachments and I wanted to add them to my calendar. My email
client (Spark) doesn't have this feature, so I created this service.
